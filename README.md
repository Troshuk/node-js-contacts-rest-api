Node.js Contacts REST API App

If you have node installed, use the following commands:
1. `npm run start`: to check how project works
2. `npm run dev`: If you're working with the code
3. `npm run test`: to run the tests

If you have docker:
1. `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build`: To start development container that would start mongodb and backend servers
2. `docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --build`: To run tests using the docker's mongodb server
